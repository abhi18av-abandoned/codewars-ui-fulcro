== Fulcro template for purely FrontEnd Apps

This template provides a good starting point for a FrontEnd application, perhaps a Graphical Interface wrapping a known API :)

- The template is used extensively for a lot of applications I'm working on.
- It's kept up to date wrt the dependencies.
- Meant to be a minimal boilerplate so you need to add ClojureScript/NPM libraries by yourself.
